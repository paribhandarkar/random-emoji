# Double Landing Page

This project is a simple web application that displays a random emoji character and its Unicode code point. The application uses the Fetch API to retrieve a list of emoji objects from the Emoji API and creates an array of objects containing the Unicode character and code point for each emoji.

When the user clicks the "Click" button, a random number is generated, and the corresponding emoji object is selected from the array. The selected emoji's character and code point are then displayed on the screen.

The project uses async/await to fetch data from the API and generate the array of emoji objects. Additionally, it uses basic event handling and DOM manipulation to update the screen when the button is clicked.

## New Things I Learned

I learned about two new concepts in JavaScript: **`async`** and **`await`**. These are used to make asynchronous code more readable and easier to work with. By using the **`async`** keyword before a function and the **`await`** keyword before a promise, we can write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous code. This makes it easier to understand what's happening in the code and reduces the likelihood of errors.

I also learned about the **`json()`** method in JavaScript. This is a method that's used to parse JSON data that's returned from an API or other source. It takes the raw JSON data as input and returns a JavaScript object that can be easily manipulated and worked with. This is useful when working with APIs that return data in JSON format, as it allows us to easily extract and use the data in our application.## New Things I Learned

## Challenges I faced

I faced some challenges while working on this project. One of the main challenges I encountered was understanding the **`async`** and **`await`** keywords, which are used for asynchronous programming in JavaScript. I wasn't familiar with this concept before, so I had to do some research and experimentation to figure out how to use them properly.

Another challenge I faced was working with the **`json()`** method, which is used to extract JSON data from an HTTP response. I hadn't used this method before, so I had to learn about it and figure out how to incorporate it into my code.

Overall, these challenges were difficult at first, but I was able to overcome them with some persistence and problem-solving. I learned a lot in the process, and I feel more confident in my abilities as a JavaScript developer now.
